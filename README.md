# Graphic Card Market Simulation

This project simulates a market for graphic cards where different agents buy and sell based on specific rules. Each agent has its own strategy for buying or selling cards in response to price changes. The goal is to observe the price dynamics and agent behavior over 1,000 iterations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher (no external libraries are required).
